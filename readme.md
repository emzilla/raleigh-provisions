# Emzilla Framework

This is a framework for me to start from for static sites, wordpress, etc.

### Version
1.0.0

### Dependencies
* node
* npm
* gulp

### Installation

You need node/npm and Gulp installed globally

To set up:
```sh
$ cd emzilla-framework
$ npm install
```
Then run 
```sh
$ gulp watch
```
to watch & compile sass and js.

Bourbon is a sass library dependency in this project. If you need to update, you'll have to manually install it.

Sass files are using ITCSS structure. See here https://github.com/itcss/itcss-netmag.
